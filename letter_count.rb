# Write a program that:
# 
# Asks the user to input a word and counts 
# from 1 to however long the word is.
# 
# Example (`apple` is the input):
# 
#   "Enter a word:"
#   apple
#   1
#   2
#   3
#   4
#   5
#   "apple is 5 letters long!"

p "Enter a word:"


# ~~~~~ Specs (make it do these things) ~~~~~
#
# letter_count.rb should count 1 to 6 with the input of 'banana' 
#
# letter_count.rb should count 1 to 15 with the input of 'fantasmagorical' 
#
# letter_count.rb should count 1 with the input of 'a'
