# Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, except:
#  - for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number
#  - for multiples of five print "Buzz" instead of the number
#  - for numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz"
#
# Your output should look something like:
#
#   1
#   2
#   "Fizz"
#   4
#   "Buzz"
#   "Fizz"
#   7
#   8
#   "Fizz"
#   "Buzz"
#   11
#   "Fizz"
#   13
#   14
#   "FizzBuzz"
#   16
#   # etc
# 
# Hint: if x is a multiple of y, that means that we can 
# divide x by y and have nothing leftover. Do we have 
# anything in our Ruby toolbox that can help find 
# remainders? Look through the previous chapters.
